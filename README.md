# Shopping-Cart

This is a program that takes items from a database showing their stock quantities, name and prices with a picture. You can add items to the a cart and it decriments the qty as well as deleting items from the cart and it will put the stock back. You can also checkout and will empty your cart and total afterwards. 

# Installation
To run this program
- download the png files, jsx and html files.
- use a strapi database for the url string for the doFetch function

# Road Map
Future improvements would be to update the items with the database stock instead of increasing the items that appear on the page. That way you only have unique items on the page instead of duplicates.
